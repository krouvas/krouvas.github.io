                In this project first a Python script was used for the simulation of a set of rounds on a realistic Monopoly board and to produce useful data. <br> These data include Priority numbers to help with deciding which property to buy and also the probability of finding a piece at each tile at the end of each round. <br> Finally, an R script was used to present the probabilities of each tile in a heatmap of the whole Monopoly board as displayed below.

                A simple text-based Rock Paper Scissors game was coded using the Python programming language. I was learning Python on my own and this was my first experience applying it, which helped me greatly improve on it. This program uses Random, or Game Theory based approaches in an attempt to defeat the player and saves scores with the use of a generated save file.

                I was allowed to plan the approach and produce a small sample of Gunpowder to be demonstrated in the GC School of Careers 2018 Science Fair. Potassium Nitrate, Sulphur and ground Charcoal in the right proportions were mixed. An 99% Alcohol solution was used to wet the sample for safety reasons and a mortar and pestle were used to grind and homogenise the mixture until I was satisfied with the result. Afterwards, the Gunpowder paste was forced through a mesh fabric to form granules which where dried over several days in a tray with paper towels and away from sources of ignition. The media below show the measured components, the grinding process, the drying process, and the final yield of this project. A burn test of a single wet granule is included as well. Unfortunately, my classmate responsible for the burning demonstration in the Science Fair burned through all of my Gunpowder without recording it but excitedly stated that: <blockquote>It was spectacular!!!<blockquote><br>

                This Tesla Radio was made by adapting components provided from a radio building kit. The schematics for it were found online and luckily all the required components except one were found in the radio building kit. The missing component was a 50 kÎ© resistor which was constructed using a strip of paper that was vigorously rubbed with a pencil lead to produce a semiconducting line and tuned depending on the separation of the 2 paperclip electrodes. This homemade resistor was tightly wound with electrical tape and can be seen along with the rest of the radio in the image below. Additionally, signal recordings of a thunderstorm, a phone call and a piezo igniter sparking are included.
